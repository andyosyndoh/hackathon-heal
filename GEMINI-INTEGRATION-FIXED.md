# 🤖 Gemini AI Integration - Complete & Enhanced

## 🚨 **All Issues Resolved & Enhanced**

### **✅ 1. Real Gemini AI Integration**
**Problem**: The chat backend was using simple fallback responses instead of calling the Gemini AI API.

**Solution**: ✅ **Fully integrated Google Gemini 1.5 Flash API** with:
- Mental health specialized system prompts
- Crisis detection and intervention protocols
- Contextual responses for anxiety, depression, stress, and other conditions
- Safety settings configured to block harmful content
- Intelligent fallback system for API unavailability

### **✅ 2. Enhanced Message Storage**
**Problem**: Chat messages weren't being properly stored or retrieved from the backend.

**Solution**: ✅ **Complete message storage system** with:
- Persistent chat session management
- Message history across browser sessions
- Rich metadata for AI responses
- User-specific message isolation
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### **✅ 3. Environment Variable Integration**
**Problem**: Gemini API key wasn't being passed to the backend functions.

**Solution**: ✅ **Seamless environment variable support** for all AI services in both Netlify Functions and Go backend.

## 🛠️ **Complete Integration Details**

### **Gemini AI Chat Function (`chat-message.js`)**

```javascript
async function getGeminiAIResponse(message) {
  const apiKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY;
  
  if (!apiKey) {
    console.warn('Gemini API key not configured, using fallback responses');
    return getFallbackResponse(message);
  }

  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest:generateContent?key=' + apiKey, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        contents: [{
          parts: [{
            text: `You are a compassionate AI mental health companion named Heal. Your role is to:

2. Use active listening techniques and validate emotions
3. Offer evidence-based coping strategies when appropriate
4. Maintain professional boundaries while being warm and understanding
5. Recognize crisis situations and guide users to professional help
6. Never provide medical diagnoses or replace professional therapy

    }

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error calling Gemini API:', error);
    return getFallbackResponse(message);
  }
}
```

### **Intelligent Fallback System**

```javascript
function getFallbackResponse(message) {
  // Crisis detection keywords
  const crisisKeywords = ['suicide', 'kill myself', 'end it all', 'hurt myself', 'self-harm', 'die', 'death'];
  const lowerMessage = message.toLowerCase();
  
  if (crisisKeywords.some(keyword => lowerMessage.includes(keyword))) {
    return "I'm really concerned about what you're sharing with me. Your life has value, and there are people who want to help. Please reach out to a crisis helpline immediately: Call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) or text 'HELLO' to 741741. You don't have to go through this alone.";
  }

  // Contextual responses based on message content
  if (lowerMessage.includes('anxious') || lowerMessage.includes('anxiety')) {
    return "I hear that you're feeling anxious, and that can be really overwhelming. Anxiety is your body's way of trying to protect you, but I understand it doesn't feel helpful right now. Have you tried any grounding techniques like the 5-4-3-2-1 method? Name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste.";
  }

  if (lowerMessage.includes('depressed') || lowerMessage.includes('depression') || lowerMessage.includes('sad')) {
    return "Thank you for sharing how you're feeling with me. Depression can make everything feel heavy and difficult, and it takes courage to reach out. Your feelings are valid, and you're not alone in this. Even small steps matter - have you been able to do anything today that brought you even a tiny bit of comfort?";
  }

  if (lowerMessage.includes('stress') || lowerMessage.includes('overwhelmed')) {
    return "It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now, and feeling overwhelmed is completely understandable. When we're stressed, everything can feel urgent and impossible to manage. Let's try to break things down - what's one small thing you could do today to take care of yourself?";
  }

  if (lowerMessage.includes('lonely') || lowerMessage.includes('alone')) {
    return "Feeling lonely can be one of the most painful experiences, and I want you to know that reaching out here shows real strength. Even though it might not feel like it, you're not truly alone - there are people who care, including me. What's one small way you might connect with someone today, even briefly?";
  }

  // Default supportive responses
  const responses = [
    "I understand how you're feeling. It takes courage to share what's on your mind. Can you tell me more about what's been bothering you?",
    "Thank you for opening up to me. Your feelings are completely valid. What would help you feel more supported right now?",
    "I'm here to listen without judgment. It sounds like you're going through a challenging time. How long have you been feeling this way?",
    "That sounds really difficult to deal with. You're not alone in this. What coping strategies have you tried before?",
    "I appreciate you trusting me with your feelings. Sometimes talking through our thoughts can help us process them better. What's one small thing that might help you feel a bit better today?",
    "Your feelings matter, and I'm glad you're sharing them with me. It's okay to not be okay sometimes. What kind of support feels most helpful to you right now?",
    "I can hear that this is weighing on you. Thank you for being vulnerable with me. What's been the hardest part about what you're going through?",
    "It sounds like you're dealing with a lot. I want you to know that seeking support is a sign of strength, not weakness. How can I best support you in this moment?"
  ];
  
  return responses[Math.floor(Math.random() * responses.length)];
}
```

## 🎯 **AI Response Types & Examples**

### **Crisis Intervention Responses**
When users mention crisis keywords (suicide, self-harm, etc.):
```
"I'm really concerned about what you're sharing with me. Your life has value, 
and there are people who want to help. Please reach out to a crisis helpline 
immediately: Call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) or text 'HELLO' to 741741. 
You don't have to go through this alone."
```

### **Anxiety Support Responses**
For anxiety-related messages:
```
"I hear that you're feeling anxious, and that can be really overwhelming. 
Anxiety is your body's way of trying to protect you, but I understand it 
doesn't feel helpful right now. Have you tried any grounding techniques 
like the 5-4-3-2-1 method?"
```

### **Depression Support Responses**
For depression-related messages:
```
"Thank you for sharing how you're feeling with me. Depression can make 
everything feel heavy and difficult, and it takes courage to reach out. 
Your feelings are valid, and you're not alone in this."
```

### **Stress Management Responses**
For stress and overwhelm:
```
"It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now, and feeling overwhelmed 
is completely understandable. When we're stressed, everything can feel 
urgent and impossible to manage. Let's try to break things down."
```

### **Loneliness Support Responses**
For loneliness and isolation:
```
"Feeling lonely can be one of the most painful experiences, and I want you 
to know that reaching out here shows real strength. Even though it might 
not feel like it, you're not truly alone."
```

## 💾 **Enhanced Message Storage System**

### **Complete Chat Session Management**
```javascript
// Create or get chat session
let session;
if (sessionId) {
  session = db.findChatSession(sessionId, userId);
}

if (!session) {
  const newSessionId = sessionId || uuidv4();
  const title = `Chat Session - ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}`;
  
  session = {
    id: newSessionId,
    user_id: userId,
    title,
    created_at: now,
    updated_at: now
  };

  db.createChatSession(session);
  console.log('Created new chat session:', session.id);
}
```

### **Message Storage with Rich Metadata**
```javascript
// Save AI message with comprehensive metadata
const aiMessage = {
  id: aiMessageId,
  session_id: session.id,
  user_id: userId,
  content: aiResponse,
  sender_type: 'ai',
  message_type: 'text',
  metadata: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'gemini-1.5-flash',
    timestamp: now,
    user_message_id: userMessageId,
    api_used: apiKey ? 'gemini' : 'fallback',
    response_time: Date.now() - startTime

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **If Gemini AI isn't working:**

1. **Check API Key Configuration**:
   - Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in Netlify dashboard
   - Ensure no extra spaces or characters in the key
   - Test the key in Google AI Studio

2. **Check API Quota**:
   - Verify your Google AI Studio quota isn't exceeded
   - Check for any API usage limits

3. **Check Function Logs**:
   - Look for Gemini API errors in Netlify function logs
   - Check for network connectivity issues

4. **Verify Fallback System**:
   - System should still work with intelligent fallback responses
   - Check that fallback responses are contextual and appropriate

### **If Messages aren't saving:**

1. **Check Authentication**:
   - Ensure JWT token is valid and not expired
   - Verify Authorization header format: `Bearer <token>`

2. **Check Database Status**:
   - Use debug endpoint to verify database status
   - Check that user exists and is authenticated

3. **Check Function Logs**:
   - Look for message storage errors in function logs
   - Verify session creation and message saving logs

### **Common Error Solutions**

1. **"Gemini API key not configured"**:
   - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY` in Netlify environment variables
   - Redeploy the site after setting the variable

2. **"Invalid or expired token"**:
   - Login again to get a fresh JWT token
   - Check that `JWT_SECRET` is set correctly

3. **"Session not found or access denied"**:
   - Verify the session belongs to the authenticated user
   - Check that session ID is valid
